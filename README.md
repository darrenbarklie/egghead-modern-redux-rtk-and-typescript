[Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) provides really nice guardrails and simplifies connection of components to a Redux store. It also includes utilities that improve TypeScript's ability to understand Redux.

This project demonstrates splitting a store into slices, creating reducers and selectors and managing async actions with thunks, by mimicing a shopping cart workflow.
